Start of an extremely simple extension to measure distances on the new Google Maps.

Currently usable just as a <a href="javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgithub.com/lantius/measure-extension/master/content-script.js';})();">bookmarklet</a>.

To use, simply click and drag the distance.

Only tested in Chrome.
