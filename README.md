Start of an extremely simple extension to measure distances on the new Google Maps.

Currently usable just as a bookmarklet; use the following in a bookmark URL:

```
javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgithub.com/lantius/measure-extension/master/content-script.js';})();
```

To use, simply click and drag the distance.

Only tested in Chrome.
